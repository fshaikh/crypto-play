4 pillars of security are: 
 - Confidentiality
    - Ensure message is not decipherable when at rest or in transit. 
    - Achieved using Symmetric/Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption
 - Integrity
    - Verify message has not been tampered with during transmission
    - Achieved using Cryptographically secured hash functions
 - Authentication
 - Non-repudiation
    - Verify the authenticity of the sender
    - Achieved using digital signature
